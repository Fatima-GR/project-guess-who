# Project Name

In this week's project, I have created my own digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who?

## The problem

I struggled during this project on implementing all the steps for the javascript file. It was challenging, first understanding the code I was giving and then, figuring out what to code in order to make this game work well. 
In the end, I made it work and I am so proud of it.
